# Project-Green-Breeze (Bachelor's Degree Capstone Project)

In a world of increasing energy demands, renewable energy must be a high priority. This is why the team at Green Breeze is developing a way to harness mass amounts of unused energy from underground train systems. High speed train systems are spread across the globe and common in China, Europe, and Japan. These trains move in excess of 200 mph, leaving mass air currents pushed to either side. The ability to harness this kinetic energy will increase efficiency and potentially lower fares.

Efficient wind turbine to capture wasted kinetic energy from moving vehicles. Can be used on roadways or in subway systems and monitored effectively. These units will be easily installed and connected to either segmented or large scale power grids. Wind turbines are not a new concept by any means, however, there is no product ready for wide scale adoption like the Green Breeze. Our product will fit seamlessly into existing power systems with little professional expertise or training.

A horizontal-axis wind turbine. Three sets of turbine blades are staggered one foot apart on a single shaft. The second and third set of blades rotated 40 and 80 degrees clockwise (respectively) in relation to the first set of blades.  Designed to be implemented within close proximity of moving automobiles and locomotives, the turbine utilizes the residual wind energy to produce electricity by means of an alternator.  The electricity generated is then sent through a regulator to control power output fluctuations.  Electricity is then converted to DC and sent to itâ€™s battery.  The battery powers all other electronics within the equipment.  Additional electronics are used to control the device as well as monitor, store, transmit, and receive all pertinent data.

The turbine produces electricity for the power grid by capturing kinetic energy produced by moving vehicles and converting it into electric energy. 
Can be used on roadways or in subway systems and monitored effectively.

Product Features: Horizontal-axis turbine with multiple sets of blades, LCD screen,  microcontroller, monitoring software, voltage regulator, battery pack, power converter, brake system

Although our design was meant to be larger and part of a subway system, for demonstration purposes it was scaled down and made into a model. General Concepts and Functionality remain the same.
